# Git GitHub Graphs

Git GitHub Graphs queries the GitHub GraphQL API to pull the following data from pull request conversations: 
- Repository
- Author of the reply
- Author location
- Author's company
- Author's organizations
- PR creation date
- PR title

I intended to learn GraphQL and practice Rust via this project as well as practically apply that knowledge towards a project for class. The resulting program is something of a script masquerading as an application. You totally shouldn't use this project for anything major! I'm constantly updating my code in hopes of improving.

I aimed for a co-contributor network but ended up with pull request data due to limitations of the GitHub GraphQL API. I'm calling the resulting graph "potential contributors" as a result.
